# Sleep Position Analysis System

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a specialized computer vision system that monitors sleeping positions on a bed using a night vision camera. The system will track the positions of two people sleeping on a bed, analyze how much time each person spends on their designated side versus the other person's side, and generate reports of this occupancy data.

## Goals and Objectives
- Create a reliable sleep position monitoring system using computer vision
- Track and identify two specific people (the user and their girlfriend) on a bed
- Define and monitor the boundary between each person's side of the bed
- Calculate and report the time each person spends on their own side versus their partner's side
- Process night vision camera footage effectively
- Generate easy-to-understand sleep position reports
- Ensure privacy and data security throughout the process

## Technical Requirements

### Hardware Requirements
- Night vision camera compatible with standard interfaces (USB/IP)
- Mounting solution for camera (ceiling mount or wall mount facing the bed)
- Computer for processing (Mac or other system)
- Sufficient storage for footage or analysis data
- Optional: Infrared illumination if the camera doesn't include it

### Software Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- OpenCV for video capture and image processing
- Human detection/tracking library (MediaPipe, TensorFlow, PyTorch, or YOLO)
- Data storage mechanism (database or file-based)
- Analysis and reporting tools (Pandas, Matplotlib)
- Optional: Privacy filtering to avoid storing actual images

## System Architecture

The system will be structured with the following components:

1. **Video Capture Module**
   - Interface with the night vision camera
   - Retrieve video frames at a consistent rate (can be lower fps for sleep tracking)
   - Handle camera exceptions and reconnection logic
   - Implement time-based recording (active only during sleeping hours)

2. **Bed Area Definition Module**
   - Define the bed boundaries in the camera frame
   - Establish the dividing line between the two sides of the bed
   - Allow for calibration and adjustment of these boundaries

3. **Person Detection and Tracking Module**
   - Identify humans in the frame (likely two specific people)
   - Track their positions over time
   - Handle occlusion and position changes
   - Determine which portion of each person is on which side of the bed

4. **Position Analysis Module**
   - Calculate the percentage/area of each person on each side of the bed
   - Track position changes over time
   - Aggregate data for time-based analysis
   - Identify patterns or notable events

5. **Data Storage Module**
   - Store position data with timestamps
   - Implement privacy considerations (avoid storing raw footage)
   - Manage data retention policies

6. **Reporting Module**
   - Generate nightly reports of sleep positions
   - Calculate time spent on each side of the bed
   - Provide visualizations of position changes
   - Track trends over multiple nights

## Potential Challenges and Considerations

- **Low Light Performance**: Ensuring accurate detection and tracking in night vision conditions
- **Occlusion**: Handling situations where one person may be partially or fully covered by blankets
- **Privacy Concerns**: Balancing effective monitoring with privacy preservation
- **Person Differentiation**: Reliably distinguishing between the two people in bed
- **Sleep Disruption**: Ensuring the system doesn't interfere with sleep (noise, lights, etc.)
- **Edge Cases**: Handling situations like guests, pets on the bed, or unusual sleeping arrangements
- **Power and Reliability**: Ensuring the system runs reliably through the night
- **Camera Positioning**: Finding the optimal mounting position that captures the entire bed clearly

## Future Enhancements

- Sleep quality correlation with position data
- Integration with other sleep tracking devices (sleep trackers, smartwatches)
- Advanced movement pattern recognition
- Thermal imaging for more accurate body tracking
- Multi-room tracking for complete sleep analysis
- Sleep environment analysis (temperature, light levels)
- Machine learning to predict optimal sleeping arrangements
- Voice-activated reporting ("How did we sleep last night?")
- Correlation of bed position data with external factors (work schedules, stress levels, etc.)
